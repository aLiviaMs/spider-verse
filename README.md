## 🛠️ Execution instructions

Follow the instructions below to run the project in your local environment:

1. Make sure you have Node.js installed on your computer. You can download the latest version of Node.js from https://nodejs.org.

2. Clone this repository on your computer or download the source code.

3. Open the terminal and navigate to the root directory of the project.

4. Install the project's dependencies by running the following command:

```bash
  npm install
```

5. Once the dependencies have been installed, start the local development server with the command:

```bash
  npm run dev
```

6. The local server will start and you can access the project in your browser via the following address:

```bash
  http://localhost:3000
```

If port 3000 is in use, Next.js will automatically come up on the next free port on the machine.
If you want to change the default port on which the application will try to come up, you can modify the port in the `next.config.js` file.
Now you're ready to explore the project in your local environment!
